## Auto-Clicker-for-Android-studio  
---  
 It's an autoclicker app that automatically lets you click on certain coordinates. I've been looking for a lot of material to make these apps. But there's not much data on this. So this repository is a sample for developers who want to make an autoclicker app.  
### Precautions  
- There may be a few bugs.  
- There might be some poor optimization.  
- Android Studio Koala | 2024.1.1 Patch 2 (This is the current version.)
